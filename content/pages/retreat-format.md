description: How the Generous work retreats are organised
---

Inspired in large part by the cocreative principles of [Burning Man](https://burningman.org), and deeply rooted in our [Kiez Burn](https://kiezburn.org), [The Borderland](https://talk.theborderland.se/main/), and other communities, our work retreats are a space for cooperative cocreation.

We organise a comfortable work environment. A place where the logistics of human life are provided for. This includes accommodation, food, morning yoga sessions, and so on. An optimal living and working environment for a temporary project.

## Projects

Each participant decides what they want to work on. They choose what resonates with them. Then they share this with us in their proposal.

We curate a selection of proposals that will fit well together, and cross match compatible skills between participants.

## Timeline

Our first retreat will be mid 2020. The expected duration is 7 days.
